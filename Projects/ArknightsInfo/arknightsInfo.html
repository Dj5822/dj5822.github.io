        Rhodes Island Pharmaceutical, Inc., or more simply Rhodes Island or Rhodes, is a pharmaceutical company that focuses on originium infection. However, behind the scenes, they also involve themselves in the more complex, societal effect of the infection, such as discrimination, and in doing so, typically employ paramilitary task forces as means to their ends. Several operators from some of the known detachments (Operation Detachment A4, Operation Preparation Detachment 1-Alpha, Operation Preparation Detachment 4-Alpha, and Operation Preparation Detachment 6-Alpha) are playable in-game.
        <br><br>
        Rhodes Island operators make home their base in the Rhodes Island Infrastructure Complex, or R.I.I.C.. It appears to be built or supported by RIM Billiton. Some operators from other factions, such as Vanilla from BlackSteel Worldwide, also make residence in the Rhodes Island base. The ship's reliability engineer is Ada Church, alias Closure.

        Rhodes Island is publicly lead by Amiya, and is advised tactically by the Doctor. Its motto, May I enjoy my life and practice my art / Respected by all men and in all times, is a quote from the Hippocratic oath, an oath that binds a medical doctor to their profession and responsibilities. Ideally, Amiya seeks to provide care and shelter for the infected, solving the oripathy crisis on a case-by-case basis and stably building a new future for the infected. As such, all operators under Rhodes Island are granted permanent medical care, and other outsourced operator such as Exusiai have also expressed interest in getting routine checkups from Rhodes Island. This ideology contrasts with Reunion Movement, who seeks to overthrow the system entirely in order to make a home for the infected.

        Great Lungmen, or more simply Lungmen, is a nation in the world of Arknights that is parallel to real-life China, but politically similar to a mix of Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tokyo, and Singapore. Wei Yenwu is the leader of the nation, and Ch'en acts as its head of security. Great Lungmen is known to be particularly harsh towards the infected, restricting them to the slums to keep them from infecting other citizens. An Annihilation Mode stage is set in this nation.
